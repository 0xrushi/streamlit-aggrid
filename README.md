# Develpoment Notes
Version 0.1.2
* added customCurrencyFormat as column type

 Version 0.1.0:
* I worked a little bit more on making the example app functional.
* Couple configuration options for update mode (How frontend updates streamlit) and for data returns (grid should return data filtered? Sorted?)
* Some basic level of row selection
* Added some docstrings specially on gridOptionsBuilder methods
* Lacks performance for production. JS Client code is slow...
